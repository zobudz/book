# Names and descriptions 

For searching for more information on the topic.

### [See and Avoid](https://www.google.com/search?q=See+and+Avoid)

The generally accepted term for avoiding collisions by making it easy for others to see you while defensively looking out for them.  Originally used before electronic systems were available and applied mostly for human visual lookout.

### Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) aka [Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system)

Available since the 1990's TCAS/ACAS "is an aircraft collision avoidance system designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air collision (MAC) between aircraft"

The terms are usually reserved for the specific standard it describes.

### [Electronic Conspicuity (EC)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Electronic+Conspicuity+%28EC%29)

Electronic Conspicuity (EC) is an umbrella term for the technology that can help pilots, unmanned aircraft users and air traffic services be more aware of what is operating in surrounding airspace.

Electronic systems for for avoiding collisions is a specific subset of EC. 

### [Detect and Avoid (DAA)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Detect+and+Avoid+%28DAA%29+aviation)

Appears as a term used to describe systems "To enable safe airspace integration of unmanned aircraft".  Its use appears mostly with unmanned instead of manned to manned air-to-air collision warning.

The DAA term in at least 1 [definition](https://consultations.caa.co.uk/future-safety/detect-and-avoid-policy-concept-consultation/supporting_documents/CAP3015%20Detect%20and%20Avoid%20Policy.pdf) goes beyond surveillance for other local aircraft and generating a warning to the pilot.  It includes aspects such as performing an avoidance manoeuvre that may be automated instead of pilot controlled.

### [Collision avoidance systems](https://www.google.com/search?q=Collision+avoidance+systems+aviation)

Appears as a generic term to describe specific equipment to perform surveillance for other local aircraft and sometimes "co-operate" by emiting the information itself.

Some of the systems thus described include a ground segment, where air-to-air systems are a subset, and some functionality includes a recieve only portion of a full system.

### [Situational awareness](https://www.google.com/search?q=Situational+awareness+aviation)

Described as "appreciating all you need to know about what is going on when the full scope of your task - flying, controlling or maintaining an aircraft" is broad, much broader than electronic systems to minimise the risk of mid-air collisions.

### [Sense and avoid](https://www.google.com/search?q=Sense+and+avoid+aviation) 

While used commonly in an aviation context, the term has been used for cases involving unmanned aircraft and may include a manoeuvre path to avoid obsticles, instead of providing a pilot warning.

### [Detect and alert](https://www.google.com/search?q=Detect+and+alert+aviation) 

While the use of the term identifies human intervention for evasive action, is has been used to describe systems that rely on ground-based optical nodes to monitor the skies, instead of air-to-air operation.

### [Airborne Collision Warning System](https://www.google.com/search?q=Airborne+Collision+Warning+System) 

A relatively under used term that fits the description of this scope, and likely to be the best title to use.
