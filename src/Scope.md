# [Electronic airprox avoidance](https://to1.uk/zobudz/)

## Scope

Electronic systems to minimise the risk of mid-air collisions in air-to-air scenarios for human pilots.

Some reasoning about the application of technologies for flight safety warning systems in aircraft telling pilots if other aircraft are in close proximity, and especially if on a converging path.

Here the focus is on systems that provide air-to-air functionality.  Some motivation for this focus is that a critical factor for warning a pilot is latency.  This focusses on how latency can be optimised in an air-to-air system.

I concur with Steve, all you are getting is a (trivial) FLARM receive, it [does] seem to transmit which is minimum.  If it were me, having bought the kit that can already do that, I'd feel like I was being fleeced.  For less than half a safety feature, it seems unconscionable to me.


««— I have changed this - the Skytraxx manual does not mention FLARM Tx, I only know it transmits from Naviter's website saying: "the FANET+ module, designed and produced by Skytraxx...includes a Flarm transmitter."

AFAIK a combination of trackers is different to the current proposals where each competitor is asked to connect their one tracker to Puretrack.
It is my and others view that Satellite trackers are the gold standard if you choose to send out locations frequently enough.  Still many will say there are few places where a GSM tracker will fall short.
While it may be better to have a combination of trackers...feeding into one place (I do),  I think that is extra complexity for most.
Please note that sharing a location via Goolge maps will locate you in an emergency as good as any other mobile solution, plus dialing 999 yourself if you can in an emergency is likely to transmit your location over any network it can see rather than just the one you are subscribed to.
