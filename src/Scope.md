## Scope

Electronic systems to minimise the risk of mid-air collisions in air-to-air scenarios for human pilots.

Some reasoning about the application of technologies for flight safety warning systems in aircraft telling pilots if other aircraft are in close proximity, and especially if on a converging path.

Here the focus is on systems that provide air-to-air functionality.  Some motivation for this focus is that a critical factor for warning a pilot is latency.  This focusses on how latency can be optimised in an air-to-air system.
