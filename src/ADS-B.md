### Physical layer

Two link solutions are used as the physical layer for relaying ADS-B position reports: 

[978 MHz link  universal access transceiver, rtca-do-282](https://standards.globalspec.com/std/2011300/rtca-do-282) Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast. RTCA. 29 July 2004. DO-282A. 

UAT is a multi-purpose aeronautical data link intended to support not only ADS-B, but also Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B), Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) and, if required in the future, supplementary ranging and positioning capabilities. The document was developed in parallel with DO-260B.
